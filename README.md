An E-mail client for the Android (java) platform. Supports IMAP, POP, and SMTP protocols through SSL/TLS.

# Download

You can download InboxPager from the free and open-source F-Droid app store.

# Usage

In order to use this application, you have to enable SSL/TLS application-email-checking through your email account's web interface. Some email servers may have this feature already turned on (NOT GMAIL!, see below). If your account's server does not support this feature, this app won't work.

You can set up an account in InboxPager by going to "Settings" > "Add Account". There you have to enter your account's credentials and server parameters. If you don't know what your email account's server parameters are, use the automatic tools provided to find out, or enter and test your own configuration. Optionally, if you'd like to receive a sound or vibration notification, tick those settings. If you wish to have a specific account refresh only when you want it to, untick the "Allow in all-accounts-refresh" in that account's settings.

By default InboxPager DOES *NOT* KEEP "FULL MESSAGE" copies of emails. It just downloads the main textual contents of the message. If you wish to change this policy, you can do this in the settings for an individual account. Keeping full messages can consume your device's internal memory very quickly. In order to save emails, the full message must first be downloaded into the internal database. Also, unless the full email message is already inside the internal database, downloading attachments will require access to the internet.

# Features

The app can:

- Animate a smooth transition between visual contexts.

- Automatically convert texts from their declared character encoding to UTF-8. 

- Download your full email messages (with attachments inside).

- Download an individual attachment.

- Display server certificates used in the last connection.

- Keep track of your unread messages.

- Notify with sound of new messages (per user choice).

- Notify with device vibration of new messages (per user choice).

- Work with OpenPGP messages.

- Verify hostnames (if self-signed certificates aren't available).

## WON'T FIX

- Automatically, on a cloud server, Save/Restore internal database. If a backup of the local device is necessary, close the app and copy/paste the database from "/data/data/...".

- Backend that runs in the background, as a constantly present service.

- Contacts integration with the rest of the Android OS.

- Forwarding messages (digests) from inside the app.

- Full IMAP folders. The app is "lite".

- Ordinary non-SSL/TLS. This includes (STARTTLS).

- Printing messages on paper. You can save them to file and print them manually.

- Automatic inclusion of the message being replied to in the new message.

# Permissions

InboxPager uses the listed android permissions accordingly:

ACCESS_NETWORK_STATE, INTERNET: Communication with user defined message servers. Downloading/Uploading messages.

VIBRATE: Device can be made to vibrate if new messages have arrived. Users can disable this setting from inside the application.

WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: To be able to save messages or attachments to the device.

READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE: To be able to send messages with attachments.

## Requirements

In general - a network connection that does not implement (small) download quotas.

For a POP (Post Office Protocol 3) mail server:

- Support for the extensions "TOP", "SASL", and "UIDL".

- LOTS of internal phone memory.

## Known Items

If there are any errors in the application, you should be able to see those in the internal application Event Log. For data leak prevention, this log is automatically deleted if the app is closed or crashes. The crashes should be visible in android's log (logcat).

- If you experience errors while downloading a large attachment, close some other applications to get more RAM.

- Message and attachment sizes are always only an approximation.

- POP has no way to know if a message has been previously seen.

- Seen messages can not become unseen twice.

- Sent messages are not saved locally inside the app; most servers will save those automatically on the server.

- Device orientation is frozen during sending and downloading to prevent crashing. This is restored when finished.

- IF YOU DOWNLOAD TOO MANY ATTACHMENTS TOO QUICKLY, your server may ban you. Download the full message and save them afterwards.

## Bug Reporting

# Gmail Configuration

To enable application access to your Gmail inbox, go to this link and enable the setting:

https://myaccount.google.com/lesssecureapps

Then, and only then, in the application:

Username: user.name@gmail.com

Incoming Mail (IMAP) Server: imap.gmail.com

Port: 993

Outgoing Mail (SMTP) Server: smtp.gmail.com

Port for SSL: 465

Sometimes checking Gmail too often (<10 minutes) can cause blocked application access to an account.

If you are using POP with Gmail, make sure to enable it from Gmail's settings web interface via browser first.

# OpenPGP Usage

In order to use cryptographic services, you need to install an app called OpenKeychain and make, or import, some pgp-keys. OpenKeychain applies OpenPGP privacy/security to a given message, and the process is described below, or (better) just look at the screenshots. Sending inline messages in non-pgp/mime standard is not supported, but third party apps exist that can do that through the system clipboard buffer.

IMPORTANT, for BCC messages:

Encrypted blocks may show the ids of the recipients' encryption keys. This may leak data if you're using the blind carbon copy (BCC) message property. For example: a message is encrypted, Alice sends to Bob and Carol; Carol is a BCC, but Carol may also see the key id of Bob.

## Signed Clear Text

Signing a clear, unencrypted message with a pgp key that will be sent using pgp/mime. This option is for those who want to be sure that a message was produced with a certain pgp key, but the message contents are not encrypted. It can include attachments.

1. Click the padlock icon, this starts the pgp implementation.

2. Choose "Sign clear text message" spinner.

3. Pick a signing key by pressing on the text button.

4. Ignore recipient keys.

5. Click "START"; that produces the pgp/mime.

6. Click "READY"; that returns you to the sending activity.

7. Press "SEND".

Some email clients may complain of a "bad signature" (i.e. Thunderbird with Enigmail). Manually checking the signature against the firts pgp/mime part with "gpg --verify signature.asc message.txt" is one solution.

## Encrypt Message

Encrypting a message, or signing and encrypting a message. This option is for those that desire more privacy for their content (for example: commercial organizations). Messages produced with this option will be encrypted, and they can optionally be signed. [Extra: If one wishes to be able to decrypt their own messages for posterity, use the option to add the signing key to the recipients. Can include attachments.]

1. Click the padlock icon; this starts the pgp implementation.

2. Choose "Encrypt" or "Sing and encrypt" from spinner.

3. Pick a signing key by pressing on the text button.

4. Pick the recipient keys by pressing on the text button.

5. Click "START", that produces the pgp/mime.

6. Click "READY", that returns you to the sending activity.

7. Press "SEND".

## Decrypt or Verify Message

Decrypt a pgp/mime message and/or only verifying the signature validity. Can save attachemnts.

1. Click the padlock icon, this starts the pgp implementation.

2. Click "START", that produces the pgp/mime.

3. Click "READY", that returns you to the message activity.

4. Clicking on the icon near the padlock displays signature verification.

5. Clicking on the attachment image button from the top now produces decrypted attachments.
